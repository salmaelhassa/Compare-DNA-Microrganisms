# Compare-DNA-Microrganisms
for this code, each line is saved into a separate file and they are then moved from being read from horizontal to vertical so that it is read as a proper sequence. Then this is saved in 2 files which are compared using cmp. This code is adaptable and can be rearranged to read genomic sequences (dna/rna). This code can be used to compare two files - two files as in sets of different RNA/DNA. ![image](https://github.com/salmaelhassa/Phylogenetics-Compare-DNA-Microrganisms/assets/129304018/c3c3c5d5-350a-447d-921c-09e7027de4db)
i used an if and else statement to give two different outputs for two different inputs - in this case the files are defined as command line arguments or positional parameters - $1 and $2.
cmp is the command that uses unix operating system. it compares two files of any type
the newline character it is used to indicate the end of a line of text - since this is the end of the sentence
